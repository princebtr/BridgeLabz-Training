//Problem Statement: Write a program to find the factors of a number and perform various tasks using the factors array
//Hint => 
//Method to find factors of a number and return them as an array. Note there are 2 for loops: one for the count and another for finding the factor and storing in the array
//Method to find the greatest factor of a Number using the factors array
//Method to find the sum of the factors using factors array and return the sum
//Method to find the product of the factors using factors array and return the product
//Method to find the product of the cube of the factors using the factors array. Use Math.pow()
